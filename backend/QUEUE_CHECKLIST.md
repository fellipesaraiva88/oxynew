  - Completed: 24h-48h (100-500 count)
  - Failed: 7 days (200-500 count)

## 🔧 Workers

- [x] MessageWorker (5 concurrent, 10 msgs/s)
- [x] CampaignWorker (3 concurrent, 100 msgs/min)
- [x] AutomationWorker (5 concurrent, 20 msgs/s)
- [x] All workers have error handlers
- [x] All workers send failed jobs to DLQ
- [x] Graceful shutdown implemented

## 🔌 Integration

- [x] Baileys → BullMQ integration (handleIncomingMessage)

- [x] Message job includes organizationId, instanceId, from, content
- [x] Jobs have unique IDs with timestamps

## 📡 Monitoring

- [x] Bull Board UI configured (/admin/queues)
- [x] Owner-only authentication (JWT middleware)
- [x] Health checks implemented:
  - /health (server status)
  - /health/redis (Redis connection)
  - /health/queues (queue stats)
- [x] Bull Board health check (/admin/queues/health)

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] Smoke test created (10 tests, 100% pass rate)
- [x] Message flow test created
- [x] Automation flow test created (with delay)
- [x] Campaign flow test created (with rate limiting)
- [x] All npm scripts configured:
  - `npm run queues:test`
  - `npm run queues:test-message`
  - `npm run queues:test-automation`
  - `npm run queues:test-campaign`

## 🛠️ Maintenance Scripts

- [x] Clean old jobs script (`queues:clean`)
- [x] Retry failed jobs script (`queues:retry-failed`)
- [x] All scripts have proper error handling
- [x] Scripts use logger for output

## 📚 Documentation

- [x] QUEUE_SYSTEM.md (complete guide)
- [x] VALIDATION_REPORT.md (test results)
- [x] QUEUE_CHECKLIST.md (this file)
- [x] Inline JSDoc comments in code
- [x] Examples in documentation
- [x] Troubleshooting section

## 🚀 Deployment

- [x] TypeScript builds without queue-related errors
- [x] package.json scripts configured
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Redis URL in .env (Upstash)
- [x] Ready for Render deploy:
  - Web Service (API + Bull Board)
  - Background Worker (3 workers)

## 🔒 Security

- [x] Multi-tenant isolation (organizationId in all jobs)
- [x] Bull Board requires authentication
- [x] Redis TLS connection
- [x] No secrets in job data
- [x] Rate limiting configured

## ⚡ Performance

- [x] Priority system working (1 < 3 < 5)
- [x] Concurrency limits set per worker
- [x] Rate limiters prevent spam
- [x] Job retention prevents memory leaks
- [x] Redis pipelining via ioredis

## 🐛 Error Handling

- [x] Try-catch in all workers
- [x] Failed jobs go to DLQ after max retries
- [x] Error logging with context
- [x] Retry with exponential backoff
- [x] No silent failures

## 📊 Metrics

- [x] Job counts accessible (waiting, active, completed, failed)
- [x] Queue stats via /health/queues
- [x] Progress tracking on long jobs (campaigns)
- [x] Timestamps on all jobs

## ✅ Final Validation

- [x] Smoke test: 10/10 passed ✅
- [x] Redis connects successfully ✅
- [x] All 3 queues initialized ✅
- [x] Jobs can be added and removed ✅
- [x] Priority configuration correct ✅
- [x] Health checks return 200 OK ✅
- [x] Workers start without errors ✅
- [x] Documentation complete ✅
